## Contributing

Pull requests welcome!

- Standard SQL preferred
- Match formatting of existing recipes ("Format Query" on BigQuery doesn't always look good)
- Name your recipe using descriptive keywords (eg `median-fcp.sql`)
- Use lots of comments whenever needed to help users understand what you're doing, why you're doing it that way, and any limitations of your approach
- Queries that consume 10+ GB must be noted in the comments
- Assign PR to @rviscomi for review
